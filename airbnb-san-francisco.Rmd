    priceSD = sd(price), # the standard deviation of the prices IEN
    priceSE = priceSD/sqrt(count) # the standard error of the price IEN
  ) %>% # use (or pass) the new object of summary values we have just created
  top_n(n = 5, wt = priceMean) %>%  # extract five records that have the highest mean price

  # call the ggplot function and create a blank canvas with neighbourhood and priceMean as the input data
  ggplot(aes(x = neighbourhood, y = priceMean)) +
  # add bars to reflect priceMean; stat = 'identity' tells geom_bar to make the bar heights correspond to the y variable (priceMean) that we called above

##### Q1: did filtering the data change which neighborhoods were identified as having the highest rental rates? 

YOUR RESPONSE FOR Q1 GOES HERE.

##### Q2: ultimately, did you filter the data, why or why not?
